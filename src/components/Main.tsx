        The MHPCC DSRC, established in 1993, is an Air Force research Laboratory
        (AFRL) Center managed by the University of Hawaii under contract to the
        Air Force Research Laboratory's Directed Energy Directorate at Kirtland
        Air Force Base, New Mexico. The MHPCC DSRC operates as one of the five
        DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers in the DoD's High Performance
        Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP). Vanguard Center for High
        Performance Computing MHPCC is the Vanguard of DOD High Performance
        Computing. MHPCC is exploring emerging technology, with new
        supercomputing architectures such as IBM POWER8+ and new HPC application
        areas such as Machine Learning all while striving to lower barriers to
        high productivity computing. Our Mission To evaluate and optimize early
        production HPC technology and provide breakthrough software solutions to
        significantly increase the breadth and impact of the HPCMP. Our Vision A
        cadre of experts immersed in a culture of innovation and collaboration,
        working together as HPCMP pathfinders to explore, evaluate, and apply
        emerging HPC technology, develop HPC-backed solutions for
        non-traditional users, and enhance user productivity through a modern
        HPC ecosystem Areas of Focus Emerging Technology - Reduce risk and
        improve performance by transitioning HPC research and benchmarking of
        hardware, application software, and refactoring approaches into HPCMP
        acquisition and operations HPC-backed Solutions - Develop breakthrough,
        HPC-backed solutions for high priority DoD use cases through focused
        application development and technical assistance by Vanguard Center
        Tiger Teams Lowering Barriers (High Productivity Computing) - Advance
        DoD productivity through a modern HPC ecosystem that integrates HW and
        SW to create dynamic workflows, increase accessibility, and enhance
        collaboration
